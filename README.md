<h2>Abstract</h2>
Every day, a large amount of data is generated in different fields. Fusing such data and providing an integrated view of them is essential to enhance data utilization. Spatial data are an important type of the data with many applications in a variety of domains including GIS, commerce, military, and tourism. Location is a key concept in the data that involved by some traditional challenges. A particular location may have different names and different locations may have the same name. Furthermore, geographical coordinates of locations may not be expressed accurately in datasets. In addition, there are other challenges that have received less attention. Sometimes different data sources describe locations in different detail. This increases data inconsistency and decreases data fusion quality. This paper concentrates on spatial data granulation to deal with this variety. If these diversities are not taken into consideration, the different descriptions of a location may be interpreted differently and, in turn, not be fused. In this paper, we use granular computing approach, in similarity measurements, introduce a new data blocking method in order to decrease pairwise comparisons, and develop a dataset for the result evaluation purpose. The proposed method is applied on two real aviation accident datasets. It is shown that the quality of entity recognition and data fusion improved after applying our proposed data granulation technique.
